# Fandemonium

Group Project #1 (Original Orginization Repo: https://github.com/ZDBootcampWork/Fandemonium)

**Overview**
As a part of a 3-person team, we came up with Fandemonium; a site for music fans that provides one-stop
shop for all pertinent information regarding your favorite artists. You can search for your favorite artists and
find links to their Wikipedia page and social media, along with (if available) an interactive map to all of their
upcoming tour dates and links to purchase tickets. My conrtibutions included the final UI design, handling and validating
user input (using JS/Moment.js, and the implementation of Bootbox.js for easy input error message modals), the AJAX
calls to the MusicGraph API to get artist links and use that information to populate the Links panel, and CSS media
queries to ensure the page looks/functions well on mobile devices.

**Technologies**
HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery/Bootstrap/Bootbox js/Moment js/bootstrap-datepicker/Bandintown API/MusicGraph API/ Mapbox GL JS API
